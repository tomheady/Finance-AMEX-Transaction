Finance::AMEX::Transaction::GRRCN::Summary - Object methods for AMEX Reconciliation file summary records.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::AMEX::Transaction;

 my $epraw = Finance::AMEX::Transaction->new(file_type => 'GRRCN');
 open my $fh, '<', '/path to GRRCN file' or die "cannot open GRRCN file: $!";

 while (my $record = $epraw->getline($fh)) {

  if ($record->type eq 'SUMMARY') {
    print $record->PAYMENT_DATE . "\n";
  }
 }

 # to parse a single line

 my $record = $epraw->parse_line('line from an GRRCN  file');
 if ($record->type eq 'SUMMARY') {
   ...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You would not normally be calling this module directly, it is one of the possible return objects from a call to F<Finance::AMEX::Transaction>'s getline method.

=method new

Returns a new L<Finance::AMEX::Transaction::GRRCN::Summary> object.

 my $record = Finance::AMEX::Transaction::GRRCN::Summary->new(line => $line);

=method type

This will always return the string SUMMARY.

 print $record->type; # SUMMARY

=method line

Returns the full line that is represented by this object.

 print $record->line;

=method RECORD_TYPE

This field contains the Record identifier, which will always be “SUMMARY” for the Summary Record.

=method PAYEE_MERCHANT_ID

This field contains the American Express-assigned Service Establishment (SE) Number of the Merchant receiving the payment/settlement.

=method SETTLEMENT_ACCOUNT_TYPE_CODE

If unused, this field will be space filled (fixed format) or blank (delimited formats).

=method AMERICAN_EXPRESS_PAYMENT_NUMBER

This field contains the American Express-assigned Payment/Settlement Number. This reference number may be used by the American Express Payee for reconciliation purposes.

=method PAYMENT_DATE

=method UNIQUE_PAYMENT_REFERENCE_NUMBER

=method PAYMENT_NET_AMOUNT

This field contains the actual Payment or Net Amount, expressed in the Payment (Settlement) currency. This is an amount credited to the payee's account for the activities listed in the detail submission records. Will be signed negative to represent a debit amount.

Calculation for Payment Net Amount = Payment Gross Amount - Payment Discount Amount - Payment Service Fee Amount - Payment Tax Amount + Payment Adjustment Amount + Opening Debit Balance Amount.

The format for all amount fields is that they are 16 bytes in length in CNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN format.

=for :list
= C = an alphanumeric value which indicates whether the amount is a credit or debit value. In the case of a credit amount a character space will appear in this position. In the case of a debit amount a minus (‘-’) will be in this position.
= N = Numeric value right aligned with leading zeros. Assumed two decimal places but will vary according to currency.

=method PAYMENT_GROSS_AMOUNT

For formats of amount values, see description in PAYMENT_NET_AMOUNT.

For formats of amount values, see description in PAYMENT_NET_AMOUNT.
