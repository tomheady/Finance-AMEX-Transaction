=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::AMEX::Transaction;

 my $epraw = Finance::AMEX::Transaction->new(file_type => 'GRRCN');
 open my $fh, '<', '/path to GRRCN file' or die "cannot open GRRCN file: $!";

 while (my $record = $epraw->getline($fh)) {

  if ($record->type eq 'FEEREVENUE') {
    print $record->PAYMENT_DATE . "\n";
