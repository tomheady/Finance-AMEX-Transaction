=head1 DESCRIPTION

You would not normally be calling this module directly, it is one of the possible return objects from a call to F<Finance::AMEX::Transaction>'s getline method.

You should only be getting this type of object if it is an unknown or invalid GRRCN file or line.

=method new

Returns a new L<Finance::AMEX::Transaction::GRRCN::Unknown> object.

 my $record = Finance::AMEX::Transaction::GRRCN::Unknown->new(line => $line);

=method type

This will always return the string UNKNOWN.

 print $record->type; # UNKNOWN

=method line

Returns the full line that was given to the object.
