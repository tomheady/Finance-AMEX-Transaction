Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPRAW::Summary - Object methods for AMEX Reconciliation file summary records.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::AMEX::Transaction;

 my $epraw = Finance::AMEX::Transaction->new(file_type => 'EPRAW');
 open my $fh, '<', '/path to EPRAW file' or die "cannot open EPRAW file: $!";

 while (my $record = $epraw->getline($fh)) {

  if ($record->type eq 'SUMMARY') {
    print $record->PAYMENT_DATE . "\n";
  }
 }

 # to parse a single line

 my $record = $epraw->parse_line('line from an EPRAW  file');
 if ($record->type eq 'SUMMARY') {
   ...
 }

 print $record->type; # SUMMARY

=method line

Returns the full line that is represented by this object.

 print $record->line;

=method field_map

Returns a hashref where the name is the record name and 
the value is an arrayref of the start position and length of that field.

 # print the start position of the PAYMENT_YEAR field
 print $record->field_map->{PAYMENT_YEAR}->[0]; # 31
