=head1 NAME

Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::ChargeSummaryPricing - Object methods for AMEX Reconciliation file summary of charge level pricing records.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::AMEX::Transaction;

 my $epraw = Finance::AMEX::Transaction->new(file_type => 'EPPRC');
 open my $fh, '<', '/path to EPPRC file' or die "cannot open EPPRC file: $!";

 while (my $record = $epraw->getline($fh)) {

  if ($record->type eq 'SOC_PRICING') {
    print $record->AMEX_PROCESS_DATE . "\n";
  }
 }

 # to parse a single line

 my $record = $epraw->parse_line('line from an EPPRC  file');
 if ($record->type eq 'SOC_PRICING') {
   ...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You would not normally be calling this module directly, it is one of the possible return objects from a call to F<Finance::AMEX::Transaction>'s getline method.

=method new

Returns a new Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::ChargeSummaryPricing object.

 my $record = Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::ChargeSummaryPricing->new(line => $line);

=method type

This will always return the string SOC_PRICING.

 print $record->type; # SOC_PRICING

=method line

Returns the full line that is represented by this object.

 print $record->line;

=method field_map

Returns an arrayref of hashrefs where the name is the record name and 
the value is an arrayref of the start position and length of that field.

 # print the start position of the PAYMENT_YEAR field
 print $record->field_map->[3]->{PAYMENT_YEAR}->[0]; # 31

=method AMEX_PAYEE_NUMBER

This field contains the Service Establishment (SE) Number of the merchant that received the payment from American Express.

Note: SE Numbers are assigned by American Express.

=method AMEX_SE_NUMBER

This field contains the Service Establishment (SE) Number of the merchant being reconciled, which may not necessarily be the same SE receiving payment (see AMEX_PAYEE_NUMBER).

This is the SE Number under which the transactions were submitted, which usually corresponds to the physical location.

=method SE_UNIT_NUMBER

This field contains the merchant-assigned SE Unit Number (usually an internal, store identifier code) that corresponds to a specific store or location.

If no value is assigned, this field is character space filled.

=method PAYMENT_YEAR

This field contains the Payment Year that corresponds to the entry in the Julian Date subfield of PAYMENT_NUMBER.

=method PAYMENT_NUMBER

This field contains the Payment Number, a reference number used by the American Express Payee to reconcile the daily settlement to the daily payment.

=method PAYMENT_NUMBER_DATE

The Julian date of the payment.

=method PAYMENT_NUMBER_TYPE

An alpha character assigned by the American Express settlement system.

=method PAYMENT_NUMBER_NUMBER

The Number of the payment.

=method RECORD_TYPE

This field contains the constant literal “2”, a Record Type code that indicates that this is a Summary of Charge (SOC) Detail Record.

=method DETAIL_RECORD_TYPE

This field contains the Detail Record Type code that indicates the type of record used in this transaction. For Summary of Charge (SOC) Level Pricing Records, this entry is always “12”

=method FEE_CODE

This field contains a Fee Code that corresponds to preceding SOC Detail Record. For valid SOC Level Pricing Record Fee
Codes, see below:

 Sr. No.   Fee Code    Fee Description

 63        PG          PIG Service Fee

=method FEE_DESCRIPTION

This field contains the Fee Description that corresponds to the amount in FEE_CODE.

=method DISCOUNT_RATE

This field contains the Discount Rate (decimal place value) used to calculate the amount American Express charged a merchant for the services that correspond to the preceding SOC Detail Record.

Note: This field is not used when this record transports data for Automated Clearing House (ACH), Expresspay or Pay in Gross (PIG) fees.

This value may be a debit or credit rate. The format is a 1-digit “sign”, followed by an 8-digit “rate”.

For a debit (a negative rate), the first position is a minus sign; and a “negative .003 (.3%)” would appear as:

 0
 123456789
 -00000300

For a credit (a positive rate), the first position is a plus sign; and a “positive .003 (.3%)” would appear as:

 0

 +00000300

If unused, position 1 in this field contains a character space; and the remaining positions are zero filled.

=method DISCOUNT_AMOUNT

This field contains the Discount Amount that American Express charged a merchant for the services that correspond to the preceding SOC Detail Record.
