=head1 NAME

Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::RecordSummaryPricing - Object methods for AMEX Transaction/Invoice (ROC) level pricing records.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::AMEX::Transaction;

 my $epraw = Finance::AMEX::Transaction->new(file_type => 'EPPRC');
 open my $fh, '<', '/path to EPPRC file' or die "cannot open EPPRC file: $!";

 while (my $record = $epraw->getline($fh)) {

  if ($record->type eq 'ROC_PRICING') {
    print $record->FEE_CODE . "\n";
  }
 }

 # to parse a single line

 my $record = $epraw->parse_line('line from an EPPRC  file');
 if ($record->type eq 'ROC_PRICING') {
   ...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You would not normally be calling this module directly, it is one of the possible return objects from a call to F<Finance::AMEX::Transaction>'s getline method.

=method new

Returns a new Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::RecordSummaryPricing object.

 my $record = Finance::AMEX::Transaction::EPPRC::Detail::RecordSummaryPricing->new(line => $line);

=method type

This will always return the string ROC_PRICING.

 print $record->type; # ROC_PRICING

=method line

Returns the full line that is represented by this object.

 print $record->line;

=method field_map

Returns an arrayref of hashrefs where the name is the record name and 
the value is an arrayref of the start position and length of that field.

 # print the start position of the PAYMENT_YEAR field
 print $record->field_map->[3]->{PAYMENT_YEAR}->[0]; # 31
